## About

OpenNOW is a custom GeForce NOW client rewritten entirely in **Native Rust** (moving away from the previous Tauri implementation) for maximum performance and lower resource usage. It uses `wgpu` and `egui` to provide a seamless, high-performance cloud gaming experience.

**Why OpenNOW?**
- **Native Performance**: Written in Rust with zero-overhead graphics bindings.
- **Uncapped Potential**: No artificial limits on FPS, resolution, or bitrate.
- **Privacy Focused**: No telemetry by default.
- **Cross-Platform**: Designed for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Support the Project

OpenNOW is a passion project developed entirely in my free time. I truly believe in open software and giving users control over their experience.

If you enjoy using the client and want to support its continued development (and keep me caffeinated ☕), please consider becoming a sponsor. Your support helps me dedicate more time to fixing bugs, adding new features, and maintaining the project.
